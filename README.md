# CIS30AProject
I will be doing Option 2 for the CIS30A course project. My program will first prompt the user to put in a monthly budget. The user will then input their monthly expenses and saving goals along with their income. We want to make sure that the users’ expenses do not pass their income since that won’t be possible. We will also want their savings goals for each month to be met so the program should offer a way for the user to know when they have reached that goal. In the end, the user will have a chance to put in their inputs again if they want to modify anything. Everything the code successfully runs, the output should also be stored in a text file.
